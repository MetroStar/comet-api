# Comet Starter API

This project is a starter template for building web APIs using Python FastAPI.

## Project Features

This project is built using the following tools and libraries:

- FastAPI for building the API
- SQLAlchemy for database interactions
- Alembic for database migrations
- Pydantic for data validation
- PyTest for unit testing
- Swagger and ReDoc for API documentation

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the established directory structure for organizing your code
- Use snake_case for variable and function names
- Use `__init__.py` files for new modules
- Use Pydantic models for request and response validation
- Use SQLAlchemy for database interactions
- Use Alembic for managing database schema changes
- Document your API endpoints using Swagger and ReDoc
- Ensure code quality by using Ruff, PyLint, Black, and isort
- Implement JWT authentication for protected routes
- Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes

## Unit Testing

- Use PyTest for writing and running unit tests
- Organize tests in a separate `tests` directory
- Write tests for all public functions and methods
- Use fixtures for setup and teardown of test environments

## Code Quality

- Use Ruff for linting and code style checks
- Use PyLint for static code analysis
- Use Black for automatic code formatting
- Use isort for sorting imports
- Aim for clean, readable, and maintainable code
